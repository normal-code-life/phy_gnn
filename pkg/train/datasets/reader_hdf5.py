"""HDF5 File Reader.

The current file creates an iterator that reads and merges data from multiple HDF5 datasets based on a given pattern.
Functions below are useful for handling and processing data spread across multiple HDF5 files,
and it supports both standard examples and sequence examples.

Note: the main logic originates from the TFRecord repository.

        Dictionary of (key, value) pairs, where the key is used to

        List of keys or dict of (key, value) pairs to extract from each
        record. The keys represent the name of the features and the
